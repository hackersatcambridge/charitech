          Our partnering charities have offered up a set of challenges for you to solve. Below you'll see some of the things you might be buildling during ChariTech (of course, you're welcome to go rogue if you have a great idea with impact).

          <p>
            Materials Science lacks fun games that can be used at secondary schools across the world. We would like to inspire the next generation of designers and engineers for materials with a game that balances materials against performance criteria. The challenge is to come up with a JS game that encourages students to select the best materials to design conventional products such as basketballs, cricket bats, etc. We will provide a list of 100 materials data and an idea on how we visualised the game as starting point, with the expectation that the guys at ChariTech will convert the idea into their own. Interested participants have the opportunity to apply for a paid Summer Internship in Cambridge with our partner Granta Design.<br><br>

            A key enabler for Madanyu is to have open-source lesson plans which teachers can use in developing countries in class and jointly with our volunteers can improve on over time. For this we seek a github solution for lesson plans, that hosts and version controls markdown lesson plans and can be shown in full spec via a browser. The challenge is to develop a minimal working solution that takes markdown lesson-plans from github and shows them to teachers and students to interact and help guide their learning in class. We will provide references to existing solutions to kick-start this process. Interested participants are invited to become a volunteer at Madanyu over this Summer and see the solution at schools in developing countries been tested live and further improved.

            Once in the hands of a frontline worker, Simprints enables real time identification of beneficiaries. However, to truly
            maximise our impact we need to put actionable data into the hands of frontline workers, managers, and policy makers to
            drive fundamental improvements in the delivery of healthcare, education, and aid distribution. Can you build an easily
            extensible data portal that plugs into a Firebase real time database?
            <br>
            Fingerprint extraction<br>
            Extraction is the detection of the unique points on a finger, called minutiae. There can be are anywhere between 20-80
            minutiae on a finger. Given a training set of fingerprint images, can you build a robust extraction algorithm? How will it
            fare against our increasingly difficult test set? Bonus points if you can classify the fingerprint as a loop, whorl or arch.

                <h3>The Cambridge Commons</h3>
                <p>
                  We are The Cambridge Commons, affiliated to the Equality Trust, and we exist to increase equality and social justice locally in Cambridge (a very unequal city!) and nationally in the UK.  We have a major new initiative called “Imagine” running for 16 months – “Imagine a better and more equal UK in 2027”.  “Imagine” is not just another social movement tackling one issue.  It aims to build a holistic view of the country we want to live in, in 2027.

                  <h4>Our challenge</h4>
                  We need to create a platform to identify individuals and organisations who would be interested in 
                  <ul>
                    <li>The specific themes we will hold events on, e.g. education or taxation or housing</li>
                    <li>The 'Imagine' programme as a whole
                  Both as attendees, and routes to attendees.  </li>
                  </ul>

                  Issues/problems/challenges:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Doing this in such a way that we can automate as much as possible of the contact, at least for individuals likely to be interested.
                    </li>
                    <li>Distinguishing, e.g.: 'office of tax collection' (irrelevant) from 'society for tax reform' (relevant)</li>
                    <li>Finding good data, and the best ways to utilise it.</li>
                  </ul> 
                </p>

                <h3>Slate2Learn</h3>
                <p>
                  Slate2Learn runs a microfranchise of low-cost digital learning centres in Delhi, for after-schooltuitions. Each centre is located in the tutors’ home and equipped with 10 android tablets and araspberry pi server. Children come once a day to learn for 40 mn on a tablet, using Slate2Learnadaptive learning programme.We offer English language courses for class 1 and 2 at present.Each centre can cater to up to 100 children.We have 3 centres running in southern suburbs of Delhi since January 2017.Data generated in the centres is sent once a day to our cloud database, with the goal ofmonitoring centres remotely.
                </p>
                <h4>Slate2Learn Dashboard</h4>
                <p>
                  To create a dashboard that allows visualization in real time of data generated inSlate2Learn learning centres.Slate2Learn wants to use the data collected in the centres to identify problems with centres, andeven their causes, in order to solve them quickly but also single out centres that perform verywell to identify and replicate best-practices.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  There are 3 sets of metrics that we need to monitor: business data, admin/management data,and learning data.The frontend technology used to create the dashboard is at the discretion of the team. Centredata will be provided to teams in JSON format, or CSV. There is a possibility for teams with a prior knowledge of Django to work on the backend of the API.
                  <br>
